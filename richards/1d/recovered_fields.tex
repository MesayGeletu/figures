Recovered simulation fields from the unconstrained joint inversion for van Genuchten parameters.
Showing (a) the pressure head and (b) the water content over the full time period of the one dimensional recovered soil profile.
The soil types are shown as annotations on each figure, the spatial location of water content measurements
are shown adjacent to the water content fields.
