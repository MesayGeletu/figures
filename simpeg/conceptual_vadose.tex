Conceptual visualization of the discipline of hydrogeophysics that uses geophysical methods in either a coupled or uncoupled way to hydrologic simulations and inversions; showing (a) the lack of computational scalability of vadose zone inversions when inverting for large scale, three dimensional parameter distributions; and (b) once these inversions are possible, there are questions with regard to model conceptualization in vadose zone inversions and interfacing to geologic knowledge.
