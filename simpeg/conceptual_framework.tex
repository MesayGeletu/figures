Conceptual visualization of the interplay between and within disciplines of hydrogeology, geophysics and geology; showing (a) the barriers between geophysical inversions and the perennial difficulties with interfacing to geologic and hydrologic knowledge and simulations; (b) the recent combining of multi-physics inversions through a largely external, \emph{ad hoc} implementation; and (c) a framework that combines geophysical simulations and inversions in a consistent, reproducible manner. The structure of the simulation and inversion framework is a research topic of this thesis.
